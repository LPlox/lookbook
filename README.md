## Designers Lookbook - ecommerce with Next.js + Storyblok

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Todo list for myself

[x] npm install --save @zeit/next-sass node-sass </br>
[x] npm install swr</br>
[x] npm install storyblok-node-client</br>
[ ] npm install --save isomorphic-unfetch</br>
[ ] set a storyblok and backend API fetch with next</br>

## Thinking it out in my readme

Make sure to do a npm install when you enter another branch

Think I have to start with the front end more before I can decide on what to do for the backend.

I need a 1. homepage 2.Collections page as default pages. Here I can get the data as getInitialProperty to the specific pages.
Everything else needs to be called from a slug.
It's probably bad practice to call the storyblok many times or on different pages. It's better to do it at one place and then distribute it in the different pages.
